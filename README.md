This project aims to calculate and compare the gas transfer velocity using methods by Reichl & Deike (2020) and Wannikhof (2014). 
The siginificant wave height, friction velocity, and wind speed data used in this project was downloaded from the EMCWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA-5) data with a monthly resolution. 
The sea surface salinity data used in this project was downloaded from the NASA OISSS L4 data with a monthly resolution. 
The sea surface temperature used in this project was downloaded from the NOAA OISST v2.1 data with a weekly resolution.
